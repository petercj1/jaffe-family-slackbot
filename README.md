The family password-remembering slackbot.Just add your bot to your workspace, invite it to a channel, and put the oauth bot token you got when you authenticated into the SLACK_BOT_TOKEN env variable.This uses sqlite to store password locally.Since the bot authenticates to your workspace using an oauth token, this should be compeltely secure (just don't put the bot in a channel that has users you don't want to get access to the passwords... and don't put apsswords in the bot that you don't want every user in the channel to be able to access).The bot accepts two commands:the ___ password is ___what is the ___ password?Everything except the password itself is case-insensitive.Make sure you never check the bot token or the passwords db into github!!!
